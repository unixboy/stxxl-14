DESCRIPTION

STXXL is an implementation of the C++ standard template library STL for
external memory (out-of-core) computations, i. e. STXXL implements containers
and algorithms that can process huge volumes of data that only fit on disks.
While the closeness to the STL supports ease of use and compatibility with
existing applications, another design priority is high performance.
